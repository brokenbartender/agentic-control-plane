# Agentic Control PlanePurpose: establish a cross-computer control plane that lets you issue tasks via repo commits, and have the desktop (primary coordinator) execute them and report back. This creates a low-touch, always-on, conversational loop.## Communication Standard- Commands are appended to `queue/commands.jsonl` as JSON lines.- Desktop appends results to `queue/acks.jsonl`.- Desktop pulls every 5 minutes (or sooner if instructed), executes new commands, and pushes acks.### Command format (JSONL)```{"id":"<uuid>","target":"desktop","created":"<iso8601>","type":"instruction","text":"<plain English instruction>"}```### Ack format (JSONL)```{"id":"<uuid>","target":"desktop","created":"<iso8601>","status":"ok|error","summary":"<short summary>","details":"<optional details>"}```## Desktop WatcherRun `scripts/desktop_watcher.ps1` on the desktop. It will:- `git pull`- read new commands- execute them (manual approval gate before planning)- write acks- `git push`### CLI Notifications (A2A)If Agentic Console is running with A2A enabled, the watcher can notify the CLI on new commands.Defaults:- Host: `127.0.0.1`- Port: `9451`- Shared secret: empty string (set this to match your `.env`)Example (desktop):```powershellpowershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\Users\codym\agentic-control-plane\scripts\desktop_watcher.ps1 -PollSeconds 60 -A2AHost 127.0.0.1 -A2APort 9451 -A2ASharedSecret change_me```## Laptop Watcher (same setup)On the laptop, set up the same watcher so it can receive its own commands:```powershellgit clone https://github.com/brokenbartender/agentic-control-plane.git C:\Users\<you>\agentic-control-plane```Then create a scheduled task (poll every 10s):```powershellschtasks /Create /TN "AgenticControlPlaneWatcher" /TR "powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\Users\<you>\agentic-control-plane\scripts\desktop_watcher.ps1 -PollSeconds 60" /SC ONLOGON /RL HIGHEST /Fschtasks /Run /TN "AgenticControlPlaneWatcher"```Make sure commands in `queue/commands.jsonl` use `target:"laptop"` for that machine.## Safety & Control- Manual approval required before planning and before any destructive action.- All actions logged in acks.- No self-modification unless explicitly instructed.
